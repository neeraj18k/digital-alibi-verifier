## Project Setup
- [ ] Create project folder structure (frontend, backend, kafka, sample-data)
- [ ] Initialize frontend with Vite + React
- [ ] Initialize backend with Express
- [ ] Set up MongoDB connection and schemas
- [ ] Configure Kafka setup
- [ ] Create .env examples for frontend and backend

## Backend Development
- [ ] Implement JWT authentication (signup, login)
- [ ] Create User schema (Mongoose)
- [ ] Create Case schema
- [ ] Create Event schema
- [ ] Create Verdict schema
- [ ] Implement auth APIs (POST /auth/signup, POST /auth/login)
- [ ] Implement case APIs (POST /cases/create, POST /events/upload, GET /cases/:id/timeline, GET /cases/:id/verdict, POST /cases/:id/email)
- [ ] Set up Kafka producer for log uploads
- [ ] Set up Kafka consumer for timeline processing
- [ ] Implement rule-based alibi engine
- [ ] Integrate Resend API for email reports

## Frontend Development
- [ ] Install and configure Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Three.js (@react-three/fiber)
- [ ] Create layout components (fixed left panel, scrollable right panel)
- [ ] Implement signup page (/signup)
- [ ] Implement login page (/login)
- [ ] Create dashboard page (/dashboard)
- [ ] Create case creation page
- [ ] Create case detail page (/cases/:id) with timeline and verdict
- [ ] Add Three.js animated scene in left panel
- [ ] Implement page transitions and animations
- [ ] Set up protected routes with JWT
- [ ] Connect frontend to backend APIs

## Sample Data and Testing
- [ ] Create sample app_usage.json
- [ ] Create sample location.json
- [ ] Create sample network.json
- [ ] Test full flow: signup -> login -> create case -> upload logs -> view timeline -> get verdict -> send email

## Documentation and Deployment
- [ ] Write professional README.md
- [ ] Ensure deployment readiness (Vercel, Railway, MongoDB Atlas)
- [ ] Final testing and bug fixes
